Now, don’t be scared by this picture, we won’t be working with all these technologies, nor you need to know every one of them.

Particularly, “Backend development” can be subdivided into the following categories:

1. **Backend languages**
2. **Databases**
3. **APIs**
4. **Hosting environments**
5. **Testing & debugging code**
6. **Security**
7. **Caching & Optimization**

We’ll now delve into each one of these categories.
