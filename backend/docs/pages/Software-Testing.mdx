# Software Testing

# Introduction

Software testing is a crucial aspect of testing for our applications. It ensures stability and resilience by validating the performance of individual modules. The most important advantage of unit testing is **automation**, we can write hundreds of test each run in a matter of milliseconds whenever we need, for example, when we made a major or even a minor change in the code.

The framework we use for testing our applications is Jest.
