# Task

Your task is to create a `Calculator` class in **Typescript** with simple methods of sum, subtraction, multiplication and division and then test these methods.

## Technical specifications

The `Calculator` class has to be a singleton class (more info: [Singleton Class](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton/typescript/examplehttps:/)) and it has to throw errors in particular situation, for example, when a division for 0 is attempted.

This class will then need to be tested, so write the tests in **Typescript** and have **Jest** run them (of course you'll need to setup the test environment, you can take `app-backend` repo as an example).
