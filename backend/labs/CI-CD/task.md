# Task

Your task is to write a Fibonacci Generator in **Typescript** and write a lambda function that takes a number `n` and returns `f(n)` where `f` is the Fibonacci Function.

## Technical specifications

Write a GET Lambda function that accepts a parameter `n` in path and returns `f(n)`.
Then write the tests in Typescript with Jest and make GitHub Action run these tests.
Finally, deploy your lambda function and ensure that everything is working.
