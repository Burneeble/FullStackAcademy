It is essential to differentiate between CSS and SCSS variables. CSS variables are more dynamic as they update automatically, enabling features like dark mode. On the other hand, SCSS variables are replaced by the chosen color during compilation and cannot be updated.

In the example below, `var(--backgroundPopupColor)` is a CSS variable. Once rendered on the website, the background property will have a value associated with a variable that can assume any color.

If it were an SCSS variable, the background property would have the value of the color associated with the variable, making it impossible to update a color dynamically.
