A **digital wallet** is an application or online service that allows users to store, manage, and transfer **digital currencies**, including **crypto assets** like **cryptocurrencies**. These digital wallets act as intermediaries between users and the **blockchain**, the technology that records all cryptocurrency transactions.

Many digital wallets, despite having different features, share some important key points:

- 🪙 They support various cryptocurrencies, enabling users to manage different **digital coins** within the same application.
- 🎨 Some digital wallets may also handle **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**, representing unique assets like digital art, collectibles, or blockchain games.
- 🔒 Security is a fundamental aspect of a digital wallet, using **encryption**, **two-factor authentication (2FA)**, and other advanced measures to protect cryptocurrencies from unauthorized access and fraud.
- 🔑 A digital wallet contains a pair of cryptographic keys: a **public key** (wallet address) for receiving cryptocurrencies and a **private key** for signing transactions and sending funds.

## 🔒 **Security**

Inside your MetaMask wallet, you will find three different security features:

### 1️⃣ **Seed phrase:** 🌱

The seed phrase is the 12-word key provided to you when creating the account. Unlike private keys, there are no multiple seeds for accounts but a single seed for the entire wallet. The security recovery phrase is very important, and you must store it responsibly because you will need it when you want to connect your wallet to a new device or in case you forget the wallet access password.

### 2️⃣ **Password:** 🔑

When creating your wallet, you will be asked to create a new password, which will be required every time you log out or close the browser. If you want to connect your wallet to a new device, you will need to enter the Seed Phrase and create a new password to access it. To better understand the concept, consider a wallet with three already known devices: to access device 1, you will not be able to use the password created on device 2 or device 3. In case of losing the password, it will be possible to reset it only if in possession of the Seed Phrase.

### 3️⃣ **Private key:** 🗝️

From the same wallet, you can have multiple accounts, each with its private key. Unlike the password, you will not generate it; MetaMask will create it for you. It can be used if you want to import a single account to another wallet, without, of course, removing it from the original one or from other wallets on which it has already been imported. Do not share the private key with anyone because at the time of importation, no other password will be requested. Therefore, if someone knows your private key, they can easily import your account.

Storing these securely:

- 📸 **Don't photograph:** Avoid storing on devices.

- 🤖 **Password manager:** Use a manager for accessibility.

- 📝 **Multiple safe locations:** Write on paper, hide securely.

- 🏦 **Bank vault or safe:** Safest for important data.

### 🔐 **Tips for MetaMask Security**

1. **Backup seed phrase:** Essential for recovery, store offline and private.

2. **Keep software updated:** Ensure latest version for security.

3. **Use device security:** Lock your devices for unauthorized access.

4. **Enable 2FA:** Add an extra layer of security.

5. **Avoid suspicious links:** Don't share your seed phrase.

6. **Use secure connections:** Interact only on secure networks.

## 💱 **Transactions**

### 🛒 Buy

To buy tokens on MetaMask, make sure you have enough ETH (Ethereum) funds in your wallet, as most transactions for buying tokens require ETH to cover gas fees (transaction fees). Also, make sure you have MetaMask configured and connected to a compatible network, such as the Ethereum Mainnet.

Then, to purchase a desired ERC-20 token, you will need to use an external cryptocurrency exchange platform, such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc. Follow the registration process to create an account on the exchange platform, providing the required personal information and verifying your identity.

After creating the account and depositing ETH funds on the exchange platform, go to the trading section and search for the market of the token you want to buy. Enter the amount of tokens you want to purchase and confirm the purchase. Once the purchase is completed, withdraw your tokens from your account on the exchange platform to your MetaMask wallet. To do this, enter your MetaMask wallet address in the withdrawal section on the exchange platform and send the tokens.

Once these steps are completed, the purchased tokens will be visible in your MetaMask wallet, and you will be able to manage them and interact with them through the MetaMask interface. Make sure to always keep your wallet security up to date and only perform transactions on reliable and secure exchange platforms.

### 📩 Send

To send ETH or ERC-20 tokens through MetaMask, make sure you have the MetaMask wallet open and enabled for the network you wish to make the transaction on (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet).

Click on the "Send" button on the main MetaMask page.

Enter the address (or public key) of the recipient in the "Recipient Address" field. You can then adjust the estimated gas fee (miner tip) to prioritize your transaction. Transactions with extremely low miner tips may experience delays or failures depending on network conditions.

Specify the amount of tokens you want to send in the "Amount" field.

Make sure to select the correct token in the "Token" field before sending the transaction. If you are sending ETH, select "ETH," otherwise, select the appropriate ERC-20 token from the list.

You can also add a note or message for the recipient if you wish.

Finally, confirm and send the transaction. MetaMask will ask you to approve the sending using your private key or PIN, depending on the security settings.

### 🔄 Exchange

The "Exchange" feature of MetaMask is a built-in feature that allows users to directly exchange tokens and cryptocurrencies within the MetaMask wallet interface, without the need to use an external exchange platform or separate decentralized exchange (DEX).

To use the "Exchange" feature, open your MetaMask wallet and make sure you are connected to the Ethereum Mainnet or another network compatible with this feature. In the MetaMask wallet section, you should see a button or option indicating "Exchange" or "Swap." Clicking on this button will present you with a list of tokens available in your wallet. Select the token you want to exchange from the list and enter the amount you want to exchange. You can also choose to exchange the entire balance of the token by clicking on the appropriate option. After specifying the amount, you will need to select the token you want to receive in exchange. The list of tokens available for exchange will appear on the same page.

Once you have selected the starting and destination tokens, the "Exchange" function will show a summary of the transaction, including the amount and exchange rate. Verify the details and click "Confirm" or "Swap" to initiate the transaction. MetaMask may ask you to approve the transaction through a pop-up window. You will need to confirm the operation using your authentication method. After approving the transaction, you will need to wait for the exchange to be executed on the blockchain. The execution speed will depend on the network congestion and the gas fees paid. Once the exchange is complete, the received tokens will be visible in your MetaMask wallet. You can check the balance of the new tokens in the wallet panel.

## 🎮 **Interacting with DApps**

- When you visit a website of a DApp compatible with MetaMask, the extension will automatically detect the presence of the DApp and show a notification.
- Click on the notification or manually open MetaMask to authorize the connection with the DApp.
- MetaMask will display a pop-up window asking for your consent to access your wallet and interact with the DApp.
- After giving your consent, you will be able to use the DApp and perform the required actions, such as buying NFTs, participating in DeFi liquidity pools, playing blockchain-based games, etc.

With this information, you're better equipped to understand and use MetaMask securely and efficiently. Remember to prioritize security, keep software updated, and safeguard your wallet login information for optimal protection of your funds and personal data.
