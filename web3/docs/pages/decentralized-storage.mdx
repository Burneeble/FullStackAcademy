# Decentralized Storage: IPFS and Swarm 🌐💾

In this lesson, we'll learn about decentralized storage and some services that are available today like IPFS and Swarm. 

Decentralized storage can be thought of as a peer-to-peer network where members pool together their disk space to create a shared global memory, kind of like Dropbox, but decentralized. Both IPFS and Swarm are similar in that they are open source, decentralized storage solutions, but they differ in implementation and approach.

## IPFS 🌐

IPFS, which stands for InterPlanetary File System, is a protocol that was published by an organization called Protocol Labs. The first implementation of the IPFS protocol was written in the Go language and published in early 2015, and today there are several alpha release implementations available, including in JavaScript.

## Swarm 🐝

Swarm is also a protocol and is part of the Ethereum Holy Trinity that makes up the serverless world computer, which consists of Swarm, Ethereum, and Whisper. These three infrastructure projects are part of a broader vision that provides a completely decentralized alternative to the currently centralized web. Ethereum would provide the computation power, Swarm would provide the storage layer, and Whisper would provide a messaging layer.

## Using Swarm 🐝

Since Swarm is already part of the Ethereum stack, a proof of concept, Go language implementation exists as part of Geth. To activate Swarm, we need to download and build Geth and Swarm from source code. 

## Using IPFS 🌐

The easiest way to install the Go implementation of IPFS is by using the installer from the IPFS website.

> **🔍 Curiosity:** The first time we request a hash from the IPFS gateway, it will take a few minutes to load. This is because the files need a few minutes to propagate through the network when first uploaded. Once propagated, the load time will be much faster.
