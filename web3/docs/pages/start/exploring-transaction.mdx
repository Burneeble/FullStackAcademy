## 🧑‍💻 Ethereum Transactions
Ethereum transactions are coming in at a rapid pace. In this guide, we will look at our own transaction.

### Transaction Details
A transaction has several data fields:

- `Transaction Hash`: This is the identifier of the whole transaction. You can always copy a transaction hash and search for it in the search bar.
- `Status`: This could either be successful or failed.
- `Block`: This is the block number that this transaction lives in.
- `Timestamp`: The exact timestamp when this transaction was validated.
- `From` and `To`: These fields show where this transaction came from and where it was sent.
- `Value`: The amount of cryptocurrency sent in the transaction.
- `Transaction Fee`: The amount that it costs to send the transaction. The transaction fee is calculated based on the gas price, the Ether price at that time, and the gas consumed by the transaction.
- `Gas`: A transaction consumes gas so that it can be processed. Depending on how much gas it uses, we need to pay for it.
- `Data`: In the case of a normal transaction, this field will be empty. But with a smart contract interaction, we might see some data in here.

> 💡 **Insight:** For each transaction, a tiny amount of Ethereum gets burned. This is to better the ecosystem.

> 🌟 **Curiosity:** If we click on the "State" tab on the transaction, we can actually see the before and after state of the wallets involved in the transaction. This is the state change that took place.

## 🔄 Creating a Transaction
To create a transaction, go to your MetaMask wallet and click on "Send". Enter the public address of the recipient and the amount of Ether you would like to send. Click "Next" and then sign your transaction. After the transaction is complete, you can see it in your transaction history.

As long as you understand that a transaction is made to change the state of the Ethereum network, then you're good to go to the next section.
