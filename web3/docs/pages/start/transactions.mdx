## 🧑‍💻 Ethereum Accounts
On Ethereum, we get three main accounts: Externally Owned User Accounts, Smart Contracts, and BLS keys (used to identify validators). 

### Externally Owned User Accounts
These accounts consist of a public and private key. The private key is used to sign transactions and to prove ownership of the account.

### Smart Contracts
Smart contracts have a public key but don't have a private key because they are managed by code. They are made up of operations that can be called to change the Ethereum ecosystem state.

## 🔄 Ethereum Transactions
A transaction is a set of instructions packaged together as a message and sent around to the Ethereum network. It tells the Ethereum network how it should alter its state.

> 💡 **Insight:** A transaction can change the Ethereum network state. For example, if Ashley sends 0.1 Ether to Daniel, the transaction will be successful if everything goes well. Then, Daniel's account will be credited with 0.1 Ether, and Ashley's account will be deducted with 0.1 Ether.

## 📋 Transaction Parameters
A transaction has several data fields:

- `From`: The public address of the account that made the transaction.
- `To`: The address of the recipient.
- `Value`: The amount of cryptocurrency being sent to the recipient's address.
- `Data`: In the case of a normal transaction, this field will be empty. But if we were to send a transaction to a smart contract, the data field might contain some of the parameters or the operations that we want to call on that smart contract.
- `Nonce`: This number increments every time a transaction is made. This is to prevent duplicate transactions being processed on the network.
- `Gas Fields`: These fields have to do with the fees associated with sending this transaction for the Ethereum network to validate them.
- `Signature`: The signature is created by your wallet or a piece of code that takes the transaction's data and signs it with the private key of the user.

> 🌟 **Curiosity:** The unit that the max priority fee per gas and the max fee per gas are specified in is known as Gwei. One Ether equals 10 to the power 18 Gwei.

As a developer, it's important to know about each and every one of these fields because we will be working with this in the future.
