### Transparency, Anonymity, and Security

The concept of blockchain was first introduced in 2008 with Bitcoin. It was created with the idea of having an electronic payment system that relies on solid and secure principles. The first principle is **transparency**, which means that all transactions are public, accessible to anyone, and cannot be falsified (we will see why shortly). This helps prevent incidents like the duplication of assets (when I mention assets, I'm referring to tokens or NFTs, for example).

The second principle is **anonymity**. When we think of blockchain, we should not think of a banking system, but rather an environment where the only identifier is an alphanumeric address. For this reason, cryptocurrencies on the internet are often used for illicit trades.

Another fundamental aspect (perhaps the most important one) is **security**. To talk about security, let's take a look at how transactions work in a blockchain. Let's take Ethereum as an example.

### Wallets and Decentralization

To use Ethereum, you will need a **wallet**, a digital wallet where you can store all your assets (whether they are tokens, ethers, or NFTs). The wallet is characterized by a **public key** and a **private key**. The public key, which is the address of your wallet, as the name suggests, can be shared with anyone. The private key, on the other hand, ensures the security of your wallet. Whoever possesses the private key has full control over what happens within your wallet. It is important, therefore, not to share it with anyone and keep it safe (we will discuss this in more detail later).

Another point (closely related to security) is **decentralization**. Blockchains are distributed networks of computers. They are not controlled by a single entity. They are based on the concept of consensus. Let me give you an example.

### Consensus and Immutability

Imagine you received 1 Ether in your wallet. How can you be sure that you actually received 1 Ether? Couldn't this value be maliciously altered? Well, no, because the transaction that establishes that you received 1 Ether is processed not by a single node but by many different and independent nodes. This is where the security of the blockchain lies: a single malicious node may have been tampered with, but since consensus comes from the entire network of nodes, the malicious node would be immediately discarded and considered unreliable.

Everything that happens in the blockchain is **immutable**; nothing can be changed except through the rules defined by the blockchain itself.

### Control and Smart Contracts

Decentralization allows you to have full control over your money and your assets in general. If you were to send money conventionally, you would have to use the services provided by a bank, which could decide to accept or reject the transaction or even freeze your account at its discretion. With blockchain, however, the same transactions are handled in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

These were some of the most important principles underlying all blockchains. Of course, it is possible to delve even further into the technical aspects, but that is not the objective of this introductory course. However, later on, you will have the opportunity to delve into many aspects and characteristics of blockchain.

### Ethereum and Smart Contracts

Now, let's specifically analyze Ethereum, which is a blockchain. Over time, Ethereum has introduced many features and, from a technical standpoint, it is much more advanced than Bitcoin. The most important feature of Ethereum is **smart contracts**. A smart contract is a program, an application created using a specific programming language. The difference, however, between a regular application on your phone or computer and smart contracts is that smart contracts are executed within the blockchain, making them immutable and unchangeable by anyone. This allows for the management of specific logic within the blockchain, such as the creation of an NFT collection, a token, and much more.

Furthermore, many other blockchains have not been developed from scratch but have chosen to use Ethereum as a starting point, becoming true technical replicas. This means that although this course focuses mainly on Ethereum, which is the most widely used network, what you will learn can be applied not only to Ethereum but also to many other blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain or Polygon.
