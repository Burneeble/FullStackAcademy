# Ethereum

## Overview

**Ethereum** is an open-source, blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate the creation and execution of decentralized applications (dApps). Conceived and proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, and officially launched in 2015, Ethereum has since been at the forefront of the blockchain industry, particularly due to its introduction of **smart contracts**—self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly encoded into lines of code.

By extending the basic principles of blockchain technology, Ethereum has made a significant impact by enabling developers to code arbitrary applications directly onto the blockchain. This unique functionality is driven by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which provides a runtime environment for smart contracts on the Ethereum network, enabling the execution of script directly on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Ether and Gas

The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network is **Ether (ETH)**. ETH is not just a tradable digital currency but also a key utility within the Ethereum ecosystem. Developers need Ether to pay for transaction fees and computational services when they use the Ethereum network—a cost metric known as **gas**. Gas measures the computational work of executing transactions, smart contracts, and dApps, effectively monetizing operations on the network and preventing spam or abuse.

## Smart Contracts

One of Ethereum's distinctive features is the concept of **smart contracts**. These self-executing contracts have the terms of the agreement—whether a transfer of tokens or a complex multiparty agreement—written into code that executes automatically when certain conditions are met. By removing the need for a middleman or trusted third-party, smart contracts increase efficiency, transparency, and trust between parties involved in a digital transaction or agreement.

## Decentralized Applications (dApps)

Ethereum is renowned for its support of **Decentralized Applications**, or **dApps**. Unlike traditional applications that run on a single computer or server, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network of computers—a blockchain. This decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over the application, which aligns with the open, democratic ethos of blockchain technology.

## Consensus Mechanisms

Ethereum currently operates on a **Proof of Work (PoW)** consensus mechanism, similar to that of Bitcoin. In this model, miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. However, Ethereum is undergoing a transformative upgrade towards a **Proof of Stake (PoS)** model, known as Ethereum 2.0, or simply Eth2. This transition is expected to significantly enhance the scalability and energy efficiency of the Ethereum network.

## Ethereum 2.0

**Ethereum 2.0**, or **Eth2**, represents an ambitious series of upgrades aimed at addressing the current limitations of the Ethereum network in terms of scalability, security, and sustainability. Perhaps the most significant change in Eth2 is the shift from the energy-intensive PoW consensus mechanism to the more sustainable and scalable PoS model. This transition is expected to not only decrease the network's environmental footprint but also improve its ability to handle a higher volume of transactions and smart contracts.
