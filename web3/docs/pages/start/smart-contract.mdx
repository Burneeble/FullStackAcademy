## Smart Contracts

**Smart contracts** are digital protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation and performance of a contract. They are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, making them immutable and tamper-proof. They're one of the fundamental building blocks that make the Ethereum blockchain programmable, enabling the development of decentralized applications (dApps).

Smart contracts automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without needing any intermediary's involvement. They're implemented on Ethereum's blockchain, leveraging its decentralized nature to provide security and trust. This automated execution removes the risk of manipulation, making transactions transparent, irreversible, and traceable.

In Ethereum, smart contracts are typically written in a programming language called **Solidity**. After creation, these contracts are deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, where their code can be interacted with. Anyone with access to the blockchain can verify the contract’s code and its execution.

## ERC20

**ERC20** is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It stands for Ethereum Request for Comments and '20' is the number assigned to this specific request. This standard provides a set of rules that a token must implement, allowing them to interact seamlessly with other tokens.

ERC20 has become a popular standard for crowdfunding projects via Initial Coin Offering (ICO), as it provides a method of interoperability between tokens. This standardization has allowed for a tremendous amount of growth in the Ethereum token ecosystem.

An ERC20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens—any one token is exactly equal to any other token; it’s like currency, and therefore, can be used as a medium of exchange on various platforms and exchanges.

## ERC721

**ERC721** is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike ERC20 tokens, each ERC721 token is unique, can have different values, and isn't interchangeable with any other token. This is why ERC721 tokens are often used to represent unique items like a particular real estate property or a specific digital collectible.

The ERC721 standard has revolutionized the digital art and collectibles market by providing a standard for representing ownership of unique items on the blockchain. It's this standard that has primarily been used to create digital collectibles and digital art, creating a whole new market for digital ownership.

## ERC1155

**ERC1155**, proposed later, is a more generalized standard that can handle both fungible (like ERC20) and non-fungible tokens (like ERC721). 

ERC1155 tokens optimize efficiency and ease of use by having smart contracts handle multiple token types. This streamlines the process, reducing the complexity of managing multiple token types within a single contract, allowing for greater efficiency in operation.

This multi-token standard opens up new possibilities for games and other applications, where you might want to have some tokens that are unique (like game heroes or weapons) and others that aren't (like in-game currency). It also allows for more complex transactions involving multiple token types to be conducted more efficiently.
