# üêù Swarm: A Decentralized Data Storage Technology üåê

Swarm is a decentralized data storage technology. It's a global network of nodes, referred to as "bees", that store and serve data. This technology powers various applications that run as programmed, respecting user's privacy and ownership. Unlike traditional data storage where you enter into an agreement with a hosting provider, Swarm operates on a peer-to-peer protocol, similar to Bitcoin or Ethereum. The agreement is with the network, which enforces the lifetime of your content.

## How Does Swarm Work? üõ†Ô∏è

When content is uploaded to Swarm, it's immediately and automaticalaly fragmented into tiny pieces called "chunks". These chunks are then copied multiple times and scattered across the network. This ensures that the data will be available at some point in the future.

> **Technical Insight üß†:** Swarm addresses data availability through storage incentives for the nodes part of the network. Similar to an envelope with a letter inside, postage stamps represent the storage fee attached to each chunk. These fees incentivize nodes to store the content for a certain period of time.

The storage fees from the entire network are collected into a reward pot at regular intervals. A system called a "shelling game" is introduced to redistribute this reward in a fair way to a single node or "bee". The more a node has at stake, the higher its chances of getting rewarded. Once a node is selected and has proven that the content it stores is relevant and safe, it can claim the reward.

> **Curiosity ü§î:** For maximum decentralization, nodes can run on standard computers, store encrypted chunks of data, and support all digital services while participating in the reward system. All you need is about 20 gigabytes of storage space and a stable network connection.

## Join Swarm ü§ù

Join Swarm to extend the blockchain to Web 3.0 and deliver the promises of a decentralized marketplace, decentralized messaging, decentralized streaming on social media, and many other types of applications. Let's proceed together, at pace.
