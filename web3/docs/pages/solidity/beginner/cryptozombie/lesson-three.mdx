## Summary

### 1. Immutability of Contracts

In Lesson 2, we thoroughly encoded the address of an external contract in our DApp. **_But what would happen if this contract had a bug?_**

> What is a blockchain contract?
> After deploying a contract on Ethereum, it becomes immutable, meaning it can never be modified or updated again. The initial code that you deploy to a contract will remain there permanently on the blockchain. This is one of the reasons why security is such a big concern in Solidity. If there is a bug in the contract code, there is no way to correct it afterward. You should instruct your users to start using a different smart contract address containing the fix.

It's unlikely, but if that were to happen, our DApp would become completely useless: the DApp would refer to an address that would never return the data it initially offered, **and we wouldn't be able to modify our contract to fix it.**

For this reason, instead of hardcoding the address of a contract, we should probably have a function `setOtherContractAddress` that allows us **to modify this address in the future** in case something happens to the contract.

BEFORE UPDATE

```solidity copy
    contract MyContract{
    address NumberInterfaceAddress =  0xab38...;
    NumberInterface numberContract =  NumberInterface(NumberInterfaceAddress); }
```

AFTER UPDATE

```solidity copy
    contract MyContract{
    NumberInterface numberContract;

    function setNumberInterfaceAddress(address _address) external onlyOwner{
    numberContract = NumberInterface(_address); }
        }
```

### 2. Owner-Only Contracts

Sometimes, we want certain functions of our contract to be external and accessible outside the contract, but we don't want just **anyone to call those functions.** In the example of the `setNumberInterfaceAddress` function, we notice the presence of the `external` keyword and the `onlyOwner` modifier. This `onlyOwner` modifier is obtained from the `Ownable` contract, which is part of the **_OpenZeppelin_** Solidity library. Its purpose is to allow only the "owner" to call the function and change the value of the interface address: even though it's marked as `external`, no one else will be able to update the contract's address.

> Read More about OpenZeppelin
> OpenZeppelin is a library of secure and community-audited smart contracts that you can use in your own DApps.

In order to interact with the functions, events, and modifiers of another contract, we **need to import the** `Ownable` **contract** and make our contract inherit from it.

```solidity copy
    import "./ownable.sol";
    contract ZombieFactory is Ownable { //body }
```

### 3. onlyOwner function modifier

A function modifier looks like a regular function but uses the keyword `modifier` instead of `function`. Furthermore, it cannot be directly called like a function. Instead, you need to **associate the modifier's name at the end of a function's definition** to change the behavior of that function.

Take note of the `onlyOwner` modifier on the `renounceOwnership` function. When you call `renounceOwnership`, the code inside `onlyOwner` is executed **first**. Then, when it encounters the `_;` instruction in `onlyOwner`, it goes back and executes the code inside `renounceOwnership`.

This mechanism allows us to **enforce certain conditions or restrictions** before executing the main body of a function. In the case of `onlyOwner`, it ensures that only the contract owner can execute the `renounceOwnership` function, and others attempting to call it will be rejected.

```solidity copy
    //modifier
    modifier onlyOwner() {
     require(isOwner());
      _; }

    //function with a modifier
    function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {
     emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner, address(0));
      _owner =  address(0); }
```

### 4. Gas: The Ethereum Fuel for DApps

In Solidity, your users have to pay each time they execute a function on the DApp using a currency called **gas**. The amount of gas required to execute a function depends on the **complexity of its logic**, meaning it is based on the amount of processing resources needed to perform that operation.

> Warning: Since executing functions costs real money for your users, code optimization is much more critical in Ethereum than in other programming languages. If your code is inefficient, your users will have to pay more to execute your functions.

#### Why is Gas necessary?

Ethereum is like a **large, slow, but extremely secure computer.** When you execute a function, every single node on the network has to run that same function to verify its output. This means thousands of nodes verifying the execution of each function.

To prevent someone from clogging the network with an **infinite loop** or consuming all the network's resources with **heavy computations**, the creators of Ethereum made the computation times and storage space of transactions paid services.

#### Nested Structure to Save Gas

In Lesson 1, we mentioned that there are _other types of `uint`._ Using `uint8` instead of `uint` (`uint256`) won't save you any gas because **Solidity reserves 256 bits of memory** regardless of the `uint` size.

**But there is an exception to this rule: within `struct`s.**

If you have multiple `uint`s inside a structure, it is preferable to **use smaller-sized uints when possible**, as this will allow Solidity to occupy less storage space.

Additionally, it is advisable to group uints of the same size. For example, a structure with fields `uint c; uint32 a; uint32 b;` will cost less gas than a structure with fields `uint32 a; uint c; uint32 b;` because the `uint32` fields are grouped together.

```solidity copy
    struct  notRecommended {
     uint32 a;
     uint b;
     uint32 c; }

    struct  tryThisInstead {
     uint32 a;
     uint32 b;
     uint c; }
```

### 5. Time Units

Solidity provides some native **units to handle time:**

- `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`, and `years`;

These will be converted into a `uint` of the **number of seconds** in that time period. So, `1 minutes` is `60`, `1 hours` is `3600` (60 seconds x 60 minutes).

- `now`.

`now` will return the current Unix timestamp of the latest block (the number of seconds passed since January 1, 1970). If you want to get the **"tomorrow" time unit**, you can simply calculate `now + 1 days`.

> Read more about Unix timestamp
> Unix time is traditionally stored as a 32-bit number. This will lead to the "Year 2038" problem, where 32-bit Unix timestamps will be full and break many legacy systems. So, if we wanted our DApp to continue functioning in 20 years, we could use a 64-bit number instead, but in the meantime, our users would have to spend more gas to use our DApp. Design decisions!

### 6. Passing structs as arguments

You can pass a storage pointer to a struct as an argument to a `private` or `internal` function. This is useful, for example, for **passing around our structs** between functions.

The syntax looks like this:

```solidity copy
function _doStuff(StructName storage _struc) internal {
  // do stuff with _struc
}
```

### 7. Public Functions & Security

You should always **check each function** you have written and see whether you have made it public or private. It is important, to ensure the security of the contract, to review the functions marked as `public` or `external` and think about ways users **might abuse them**. If they are not restricted by a `modifier` like `onlyOwner`, any user can call such a function and pass any value they want.

### 8. Function modifiers with arguments

Previously we looked at the simple example of `onlyOwner`. But **function modifiers** can also take arguments. For example:

```solidity copy
// A mapping to store a user's age:
mapping (uint => uint) public age;

// Modifier that requires this user to be older than a certain age:
modifier olderThan(uint _age, uint _userId) {
  require(age[_userId] >= _age);
  _;
}

// Must be older than 16 to drive a car (in the US, at least).
// We can call the `olderThan` modifier with arguments like so:
function driveCar(uint _userId) public olderThan(16, _userId) {
  // Some function logic
}

```

You can see here that the `olderThan` modifier takes arguments just like a function does. And that the `driveCar` function passes its arguments to the modifier.

### 9. Saving Gas With 'View' Functions

`view` functions **don't cost any gas** when they're called externally by a user.

This is because `view` functions don't actually change anything on the blockchain â€“ they **only read** the data. So marking a function with `view` tells `web3.js` that it only needs to query your local Ethereum node to run the function, and it doesn't actually have to **create a transaction** on the blockchain (which would need to be run on every single node, and cost gas).

> Note: If a `view` function is called internally from another function in the same contract that is **not** a `view` function, it will still cost gas. This is because the other function creates a transaction on Ethereum, and will still need to be verified from every node. So `view` functions are only free when they're called externally.

### 10. Storage is Expensive

One of the most expensive operations in Solidity is the use of `storage`, especially when writing data.

This is because every time you write or modify data, it is permanently written to the blockchain. Thousands of nodes around the world **have to store such data** on their hard drives, and this data continues to grow over time as the blockchain expands.

In order to contain costs, you want to avoid writing data to storage unless absolutely necessary. In Solidity, performing loops on large datasets is much cheaper when using `view` functions compared to using `storage`, as `view` functions do not cost any gas to the users.

#### Declaring arrays in memory

You can use the `memory` keyword with arrays to create a new array inside a function **without needing** to write anything to storage. The array will only exist until the end of the function call, and this is a **lot cheaper gas**

```solidity copy
function getArray() external pure returns(uint[]) {
// Crea un nuovo array in memoria con una lunghezza di 3

uint[] memory values =  new  uint[](3);

// Aggiungi alcuni valori ad esso
values.push(1);
values.push(2);
values.push(3);

// Restituisce l'array  return values; }
```

#### Using `for` loops

The syntax of `for` loops in Solidity is similar to JavaScript.

Let's look at an example where we want to make an array of even numbers:

```solidity copy
function getEvens() pure external returns(uint[] memory) {
  uint[] memory evens = new uint[](5);
  // Keep track of the index in the new array:
  uint counter = 0;
  // Iterate 1 through 10 with a for loop:
  for (uint i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    // If `i` is even...
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
      // Add it to our array
      evens[counter] = i;
      // Increment counter to the next empty index in `evens`:
      counter++;
    }
  }
  return evens;
}

```

This function will return an array with the contents `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.
