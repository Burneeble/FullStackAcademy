## 2. Zombies attacks their victims

### Introduction: [CryptoZombies LESSON 2](https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/2/chapter/1)

In lesson 2, we're going to make our app more game-like:

- We're going to make it multi-player (it will be able to interact with other contracts),
- we'll also be adding a more fun way to create zombies instead of just generating them randomly.

## Summary

During lesson 2 the main topics you will face are the following:

### 1. Addresses and Mappings:

An address **uniquely** identifies an account (e.g., `0x0cE4462555L2OF44C46F1df9Cc969`). Addresses are owned by users or smart contracts and are used for Ether transactions. In DApps, addresses can serve as unique IDs for ownership or access rights.

Mappings are **key-value stores** that effectively organize data in Solidity. They associate one value with another, facilitating efficient data retrieval and organization in smart contracts.

```solidity copy
mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance;
mapping (uint => string) public userIdToName;
```

- `accountBalance` associates addresses with unsigned integers, storing users' account balances.
- `userIdToName` connects user IDs (uint) with usernames (string).

### 2. Understanding `msg.sender`:

`msg.sender` is a **global variable** representing the caller's address (person or smart contract) of the current function. It allows contracts to identify the interacting entity.

```solidity copy {5, 12}
mapping (address => uint) favoriteNumber;

function setMyNumber(uint _myNumber) public {
  // Update our `favoriteNumber` mapping to store `_myNumber` under `msg.sender`
  favoriteNumber[msg.sender] = _myNumber;
  // ^ The syntax for storing data in a mapping is just like with arrays
}

function whatIsMyNumber() public view returns (uint) {
  // Retrieve the value stored in the sender's address
  // Will be `0` if the sender hasn't called `setMyNumber` yet
  return favoriteNumber[msg.sender];
}
```

### 3. Using `require`:

`require` is a function that checks conditions before executing another function. If the condition is false, function execution stops, and an error is thrown.

```solidity copy {2}
function sayHiToVitalik(string memory _name) public returns (string memory) {
  require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_name)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Vitalik")));
  return "Hi!";
}
```

### 4. Contract Inheritance:

Contracts can **inherit** functions and variables from parent contracts, enabling logical inheritance and code organization.
For example, consider the contracts `Doge` and `BabyDoge`:

```solidity copy /BabyDoge is Doge/
contract Doge {
  function catchphrase() public returns (string memory) {
    return "So Wow CryptoDoge";
  }
}

contract BabyDoge is Doge {
  function anotherCatchphrase() public returns (string memory) {
    return "Such Moon BabyDoge";
  }
}
```

### 5. Importing Files:

The `import` keyword is used to include one file's contents into another in Solidity.

```solidity copy {1}
import "./someothercontract.sol";

contract NewContract is SomeOtherContract {

}
```

### 6. Data Location - Storage vs. Memory:

Solidity has two locations to store variables: **storage** and **memory**.

<Callout>
  Storage variables are permanently stored on the blockchain, while memory
  variables are temporary and erased between external function calls.
</Callout>

```solidity copy /storage/1 /memory/
contract SandwichFactory {
  struct Sandwich {
    string name;
    string status;
  }

Sandwich[] sandwiches;

function eatSandwich(uint \_index) public {
Sandwich storage mySandwich = sandwiches[_index];
mySandwich.status = "Eaten!"; // Permanently changes `sandwiches[_index]` on the blockchain.

    Sandwich memory anotherSandwich = sandwiches[_index + 1];
    anotherSandwich.status = "Eaten!"; // Only modifies the temporary variable, not `sandwiches[_index + 1]`.
    sandwiches[_index + 1] = anotherSandwich; // Copy the changes back into blockchain storage.

}
}

```

### 7. Function Visibility:

Function visibility determines how and where functions can be accessed:

- **Public**: Accessible from any context, internally and externally.
- **Private**: Accessible only within the same contract, not inherited.
- **Internal**: Accessible within the same contract and contracts inheriting from it.
- **External**: Accessible externally, cannot be called by other functions within the same contract.

```solidity copy /Private/
function setMyNumber(uint _myNumber) Private {
}
```

### 8. Using Interfaces:

**Interfaces** define how to communicate with **external contracts** and specify functions to interact with. They enable contract interaction, data retrieval, and communication between contracts.

```solidity copy
contract LuckyNumber {
  mapping(address => uint) numbers;

  function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint) {
    return numbers[_myAddress];
  }
}
```

To interact with this contract, we create an interface, which looks similar to a contract definition, but without function bodies:

```solidity copy
contract NumberInterface {
  function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint);
}
```

We can use it in a contract as follows:

```solidity copy
contract MyContract {
  address NumberInterfaceAddress = 0xab38...;
  // ^ The address of the FavoriteNumber contract on Ethereum
  NumberInterface numberContract = NumberInterface(NumberInterfaceAddress);
  // Now `numberContract` is pointing to the other contract
}
```

### 9. Handling Multiple Return Values:

Functions can return multiple values in Solidity.

<Callout>
  Use multiple assignment to retrieve and store multiple return values, allowing
  efficient work with functions providing multiple results.
</Callout>

```solidity copy {2}
function multipleReturns() internal returns(uint a, uint b, uint c) {
  return (1, 2, 3);
}
```

To handle multiple return values, we use multiple assignment, as shown in the `processMultipleReturns()` function:

```solidity copy {6}
function processMultipleReturns() external {
  uint a;
  uint b;
  uint c;
  // This is how you do multiple assignment:
  (a, b, c) = multipleReturns();
}
```

The values returned by `multipleReturns()` are assigned to variables `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.
If we are interested in only specific return values, we can use blank assignments for the other values, as demonstrated in the `getLastReturnValue()` function:

```solidity copy {4}
function getLastReturnValue() external {
  uint c;
  // We can just leave the other fields blank:
  (,,c) = multipleReturns();
}
```
