## 1. Making the Zombie Factory (Your first Contract)

### Introduction: [CryptoZombies 1 LESSON](https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/1/chapter/1)

You're going to build a "Zombie Factory" (your first contract) able to build an army of zombies:

- Our contract will maintain a database of all zombies in our army;
- Our contract will have a function for creating new zombies;
- Each zombie will have a random and unique appearance which will be based on its DNA.
  `8356281049284737`

Its DNA is simple — it's a 16-digit integer, different parts of this number will map to different traits.

## Summary

### 2. Contracts

Solidity's code is encapsulated in **contracts**.

> Contracts
>
> A `contract` is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications — all variables and functions belong to a contract

All solidity source code should start with a "**version pragma**" — a declaration of the version of the Solidity compiler this code should use.

```solidity
   pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

   contract ZombieFactory {
   //contract body
   }
```

### 3. State Variables & Integers

**State variables** are permanently stored in contract storage. This means they are written to the Ethereum blockchain. These variables are declared using the `uint` data type, its value must be non-negative.

```solidity
    contract ZombieFactory {
    // This will be stored permanently in the blockchain
      uint dnaDigits =  16;
    }
```

> Different uint:
>
> In Solidity, uint is actually an alias for uint256, a 256-bit unsigned integer. You can declare uints with less bits — uint8, uint16, uint32, etc.. But in general you want to simply use uint except in specific cases, which we'll talk about in later lessons.

### 4. Math Operations

Among the most basic **math operations** that solidity supports (such as sum, difference, etc.) we mention:

- Exponential operator (i.e. x^y):
  `uint x = 5 ** 2; // equal to 5^2 = 25`

- Modulus / remainder: **x % y** (for example, 13 % 5 is 3, because if you divide 5 into 13, 3 is the remainder)

### 5. Structs

Solidity provides **_structs_** allow you to create more complicated data types that have multiple properties:

```solidity
struct Zombie {
  string name;
  uint dna;
}
```

### 6. Arrays

There are two types of arrays in Solidity: **fixed arrays and dynamic arrays:**

```solidity
// Array with a fixed length of 2 elements:
uint[2] fixedArray;

// a dynamic Array - has no fixed size, can keep growing:
uint[] dynamicArray;

// a dynamic Array of struct:
Person[] people;
```

You can declare an **array as public**, Other contracts would then be able to read from, but not write to, this array. So this is a useful pattern for storing public data in your contract

```solidity
// a dynamic public Array of struct:
Person[] public people;
```

### 7: Working With Structs and Arrays

Here is how to create new `Zombie`s (our struct) and add them to our `zombies` array.

```solidity
// create a New Zombie:
 Zombie michael = Zombie(172, "Michael");

// Add that person to the Array:
zombies.push(michael);
```

### 8. Function Declarations

A function declaration in solidity looks like the following:

```solidity
function eatHamburgers(string memory _name, uint _amount) public {
}
```

Keep note we're providing instructions about where the `_name` variable should be stored- in `memory`. This is required for all reference types such as arrays, structs, mappings, and strings.

> Value & Reference Types
> You can pass an argument to a Solidity function:
>
> - By value, which means that the Solidity compiler creates a new copy of the parameter's value and passes it to your function. This allows your function to modify the value without worrying that the value of the initial parameter gets changed.
> - By reference, which means that your function is called with a... reference to the original variable. Thus, if your function changes the value of the variable it receives, the value of the original variable gets changed.

### 9. Private / Public Functions

- `Public` function: (by default) Anyone (or any other contract) can call your contract's function and execute its code. This can make your contract vulnerable to attacks.
- `Private` function: only other functions within your contract will be able to call your contract's functions.

### 10. More on functions

- Return function: the function declaration contains the type of the return value (in this case `string`).

```solidity
function sayHello() public returns (string) {}
```

- View function modifier: The function is only viewing the data but not modifying it.

```solidity
function sayHello() public view returns (string) {}
```

- Pure function modifier: The function is not even accessing any data in the app. Its return value depends only on its function parameters.

```solidity
function _multiply(uint a, uint b) private pure returns (uint) {
 return a * b;
 }
```

> When to use Pure and View?
> It may be hard to remember when to mark functions as pure/view. Luckily the Solidity compiler is good about issuing warnings to let you know when you should use one of these modifiers.

### 11. Keccak256

If we want our function to return a (semi) random `uint` we have to use Keccak256, an ethereum hash function. This hash function expects a single parameter of type `bytes`. This means that we have to "pack" any parameters before calling `keccak256`, in this way:

```solidity
keccak256(abi.encodePacked("aaaac"));
```

> Learn More About keccak256
> A hash function basically maps an input into a random 256-bit hexadecimal number. A slight change in the input will cause a large change in the hash. It's useful for many other purposes in Ethereum.

### 12. Events

To create an event first you have to declare it before the function in which later we will fire it.

> **_Events_**
>
> Events are a way for your contract to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app front-end, which can
> be 'listening' for certain events and take action when they happen.

```solidity
// declare the event
event IntegersAdded(uint x, uint y, uint result);

function add(uint _x, uint _y) public returns (uint) {
uint result = _x + _y;

// fire an event to let the app know the function was called:
emit IntegersAdded(_x, _y, result);

return result; }
```

**_Front-end Event Integration_**
Your app front-end could then listen for the event. A JavaScript implementation would look something like:

```solidity
YourContract.IntegersAdded(function(error, result) {
  // do something with result
})
```
