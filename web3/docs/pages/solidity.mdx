# 📝 Solidity Programming

## Introduction

Now, we're going to learn the Solidity programming language . This will be a fast-paced introduction to the really important parts of the Solidity programming language that you're going to use over and over again.

## What is Solidity?

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are the building blocks of blockchain-based applications. They're called smart contracts because they represent digital agreements and the code cannot change once it's put on the blockchain.

## Use Cases for Solidity

The most common use cases for Solidity smart contracts are tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) with things like savings, lending, yield farming, trading, and flash loans.

## Features of Solidity

Solidity supports basic features of programming languages like data types, variables, and functions. It also supports more advanced features like inheritance, interfaces, and events.

> Solidity is a Turing complete programming language, which means it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. This makes it a powerful tool for creating complex smart contracts.

## Interacting with Other Smart Contracts

Solidity allows you to interact with other smart contracts. You can either import the complete code of another smart contract or use interfaces to interact with specific functions of another smart contract.
